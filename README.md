# Calculator

Basic mathematical operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be carried out using this calculator. HTML, CSS, and Javascript will be used in the calculator's design.

The calculator's structure and styling will be provided via HTML and CSS, which will also be used to construct the user interface. The calculator will have buttons for each arithmetic operation and for the numbers 0 to 9. The display area will show the numbers and outcomes of the operations.

Javascript will be used in the calculator's implementation of its features. The calculator will carry out the requested operation and show the result on the display area after the buttons are programmed to react to user input.
These characteristics will be present in the calculator:

buttons for the (+, -, x, /) arithmetic operations
Numbers 0â€“9 buttons
a button to "clear" the display area.
an equals button to carry out the chosen action
a button with a decimal point for entering decimal numbers.
the capacity to carry out several procedures within a single calculation

The calculator's structure and style will be created using HTML and CSS, and its functionality will be implemented using Javascript code.
